    “Ehem– Is this mic working?” said Flepperblip looking over his shoulder at the technician located behind the flimsy, almost cheap, wall. Encircled away from the audience’s view in the makeshift stage, high up in the air. A loud ring reverberated in everyone’s ears, as Flepperblip tilted the microphone sideways.
    
    “Ah! There it is,” he continued, smiling back at the crowd below him and flipping the microphone up. “I knew they wouldn’t let me down.” the production team winced in place, as Flepperblip’s eyes seized them yet again for all but one second, everyone keeping their hands where they needed to be. Holding the cables to the stage, almost as comical as the declaration about to ensue. As if they feared what they had to do.
    “Anyways, I thank you all for coming here today, as I would like to get this apology done in one go.” the uncertainty could be felt from at least 70% of the 15,954 people standing within Flepperblip’s smile’s 3 mile radius. Glances traced in every direction, as if to avert direct eye contact at all costs.
    
    “I never intended for the Narratron to become what it is today,” he chanted, almost rhythmically, but still monotone, as his eyes didn’t attempt to hide their close relationship with the phone in his hands. “But alas, it has developed as such. And as most of you could have already guessed, I haven’t had control of it for the past months. Or really since I released it.” There was a pause in his throat, as if Flepperblip fought against his own voice. “I don’t even know if I ever had an input while designing–” his diminishing voice is cut off with a shiver, recoiling into himself ever so slightly, before he puts his phone in his pocket, proceeding to hold the mic stand once again. ”I would like to state that Narratron is someone else’s issue,” Flepperblip’s eyes achieved the audience’s now almost revolted gaze. “And I will not be reading all of this crap to apologize for something that has entertained all of you, how–” click. There went the wall, tumbling down the 110 meters to the floor, followed by a snapping cable that previously held up the stage, obviously no longer doing its job. Whether the fault lied with the cable or those assigned to it, was not known.
    
    Flepperblip had almost no time to react. Looking back at the production team he saw not a single member left on the stage, all lodged in the helicopter flying by. Where the fault lied, was pretty clear now. Not that he could do anything against gravity, his feet slipping from under him.
    
    As Flepperblip tumbled down the 45 degree slope forwards and then downwards, microphone lodged ungracefully inside his mouth, jaw snapped open by force, only his grunts could be heard through the rolling speakers.
    
    Yet out of the entire crowd gathered, Clazzmozzle was the only person who went closer to the mess, instead of further, as everything fell down. Not seeming to care about the falling apparatus. As a wife should.

      <strong>Chapter 1 - Felix Quentin</strong>
    🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
    

    I hope this time it doesn’t burn through the fur– Woah! It works!. Felix thought as he looked at the webpage filling out with his every thought and action. His arms flinging up quickly in joy and receding just as fast after hitting the ceiling fan, so hurriedly he almost hit his own leg on the way down. Joy subsided by pain, but not gone.
    “After 6 years in the making!” he exclaimed out loud, now holding the teddy bear almost as high as the fan, but having learned his lesson. Felix lets out a sigh of relief, imbued with something deeper. Damn whoever said code can’t fix all of your issues.
    
    He stared at the complex code totaling so many lines he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, keep track of. There were dozens of corrupted looking files in the folder. But it worked, “If it works, don’t touch it!” 
    
    Felix hadn’t really thought he would ever succeed in this drawn out battle against Python. But he had stayed with Claire for so long, for personal reasons, but also to test it out on her brain. And now he would finally have concrete evidence he was right–that he could indeed understand a girl’s mind, if only by reading its literal thoughts. Anything to win that promised pint from his friends’ bet, and a crazy bag of money too. I wonder what her face is going to look like when she sees this hehe. “Do you think she’ll think you’re cute?” he questioned the bear still in his hands, noticing how crazy he must have looked speaking to a stuffed animal.
    
    Felix promptly went to sleep and, anxious for the next day, forgot to turn off the computer after sending the great news email to his boss, that his project was now finally completed. Teddy bear in hand, he laid down and closed his eyes.
    
    As Felix woke up, his train of thought had never been clearer. He quickly put on his jacket, keeping the same shirt, pants, socks, shoes and underwear he wore the previous day. His attention switched from the door down the long hallway, to the computer, reading the narration of his wake up routine. His face scrunching like a drawstring bag. “Wow, you didn’t have to call me disgusting like that…” his words drifted away as he looked down at the bear, what would be a good name for you? Felix stared intensely at the teddy bear. “Narratron!” he blurted, not much thought had been done then. Narratron was shaken side to side, with no reaction. No complaints? Narratron it is. Felix put down Narratron and proceeded to change clothes, promptly heading outside the door.

    As Felix rounded the fountain on the plaza, his eyes met with Claire’s. His mouth tugging into a smile he did not seem to notice was forming.
    
    Claire looked overjoyed as Felix extended his hand out with Narratron before even saying anything, a handmade teddy bear, the first thoughtful gift Felix had ever given her. Claire hugged him tightly, her eyes closed, as a smirk was plastered across Felix’s face. Yet his hands didn’t properly lay around her waist or shoulder, but instead glided onto her protuberant butt, giving it a squeeze. He could almost feel part of Claire’s joy evaporate, but paid it no mind. Until she pulled away from him, half smiling and looking from, now her teddy bear, back to him multiple times. I knew she wouldn’t notice anything weird. “Do you like him or love him?” Felix asked, placing one hand on his hip and fixing his smooth hair that laid upon his forehead with the other. “I can’t believe you made him for me! Look at his little face..” Claire said, now focusing only on Narratron.
    
    -Felix scan completed-
    
    Felix didn’t notice his own face had a smile again. He cared for her, even if he was a subpar partner, and refused to admit to his feelings. “I hope all your wishes come true baby, tell them all to the bear and they just might!” he finished saying, getting closer again, putting his hand behind Claire’s hip, drawing her in gently. She averted her eyes from the bear to his face again. Felix noticed all the details he had already seen in her face countless times.

      <strong>Chapter 2 - Claire Grover</strong>
    🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻


    Claire had only dreamed of receiving such a nice gift, especially from Felix. She stared into Felix’s eyes, seeing not only him, but every imperfection and perfection she had memorized, still finding it so cunning. You make it impossible to not love you, silly, but there’s something wrong here. This is too sudden. 
    
    Claire reached out a hand and placed it on his cheek, running her fingers down to his lips, then to the back of his neck, using it as leverage to pull herself closer and nozzle her lips onto his. She could see he was pleased enough by that and pulled away. “I need to get to class, Dr. Mernandez is going to kill me if I am late again and,” she looked down at her wristwatch, noticing she only had two minutes to make the eight minute walk. “I already don’t have enough time!” she exclaimed, turning around on her heels, breaking free from Felix’s touch and darting. She turned around to blow one last kiss to Felix, quickly switching back to facing her running direction. 
    
    “I hope you make it in time, baby,” Felix muttered as he turned away, smiling. Claire appreciated the thought, but knew it wouldn’t happen.
    
    Claire was sprinting to the best of her abilities, but she had never been the best at most things in life, especially not at running. So she knew her pace wouldn’t hit the two minute death sentence calculus three had on her. But to her surprise, by the time she opened the doors, as quietly as possible, the minute hand on the clock had not yet reached the 12 mark. Huh?? How come I made it in time.. Dr. Mernandez wasn’t a technological man, so he relied on the clock on the wall to start his class. Claire noticed her wrist watch said 12:03, which made her giggle at the unusual blessing. She shook her head and sat down in her unassigned assigned seat.
    
    Claire looked down at Narratron and smiled, remembering Felix’s face and his soft words, coming out of his smooth lips, as the light hit his hair at just the right angle to make the blackest strands on his scalp look golden. She remembered him saying Narratron would always listen to her wishes. I wish I could carry you around without having to hold you all the time, just like I wanted to lock your silly dad up so he would behave. Claire looked at her lecturer and put Narratron on her lap, as ready as ever to learn about triple integrals.
    
    -Deleted content (Code001)-
    
    Claire decided to skip the last class at eight pm and head home early to see Flepperblip. No one goes to that lab anyways, classes this late should be illegal. It was their six year anniversary after all. Then as soon as she finished eating her 90% useless, 10% doubtful plate for dinner at the cafeteria, she chucked it to the top of the trash pile and wrung her backpack over her shoulder, walking, not fast like this morning, but still not slow.
    
    Claire arrives at Flepperblip's apartment complex and finally remembers Narratron, more importantly how she isn’t holding him anymore, not remembering when she had put him down, if she had done so at all. But she blames it on excitement and tiredness from a long day. I will search for it later, I am sure someone took him into the lost and found at Alderson Hall, Felix probably couldn’t care less if I actually have the bear on me either way. She puts those thoughts aside, bringing back the content expression of being able to see him again. 
    
    A wicked thought crosses her mind, entering so quietly that the, most likely asleep, boyfriend wouldn’t hear her, just to scare him a little bit. After all he always says he would like to be surprised while sleeping right? Though this may not be what he meant.. She slowly pushes the door, sneaking one foot in front of the other, holding her breath and her noisy keychains.
    
    As she feels her way down the entrance corridor, eyes adapting to the darkness of his apartment, she notices the place feels cold. Too cold. There is but one light emanating from the bedroom room, and it comes from where his desk stands. Carefully, she hugs the corner towards it, looking to her left, as if attempting to see if he was gaming in the middle of the afternoon again. Yet he was not, and in his place, the screen itself caught her attention. Bearing furiously updating files and logged outputs. This is one of the few times Claire remembers Flepperblip is indeed a computer science student after all, even if, sometimes, his carefree attitude may overshadow his gift. 
    
    Claire glances over to his bed, assembled on the rightmost corner of the walls, and sees him laying down. Wishing to be by his side, she remembers the glowing screen again. Sometimes curiosity just gets the best of you man. She threads toward the bright green gaming chair, looking greyscale in the lighting. As she carefully sits down, one specific file catches her eyes, tucked inside of what seemed like at least 5 domains, named “Felix_Flepperblip.clo”.
    
    As she reaches for the mouse, eager to see what the file is, she accidently presses “esc” with her other hand, revealing a pretty blog. Covered in brown tones, a quick reminder of her teddy bear again. Then of his absence. Her eyes fade back into the real world and she starts reading what the blog says. Hey eyes fade back into the real world and she starts, “What the hell? Is this thing typing what I am thinking?” Claire exclaims. Thinking she has gone insane, she promptly forgets her previous goal of being quiet. She stands up from the chair as it rolls backwards with a whine from the wheels. Her eyes glued to the screen. She lifts her arms up. Then down. Then jumps and looks at her hands, then up at the screen again. Incredulous, she finally notices the name of the entry in the blog post. Claire Grover. She propels her body towards the screen, rereading the post. Before she could think about it further, Claire hears rustling from the bed behind her and presses “esc” at something close to the speed of sound. She turns towards the bed, walking forward and making sure to push the chair back to its original spot, as if nothing had happened. 
    
    Flepperblip’s eyes seemed to start to open, not without some struggle. She wipes her brain from whatever was in the computer, blaming it on drinking two red-bulls for breakfast at 8am and consuming nothing else after. Starvation can do crazy things to humans, what even is a .clo file anyway...
    Claire sits by his bed, waiting until he gains his consciousness back and sits up with her. 
    
    “Hey baby, when did you come in?” Flepperblip asks almost monotonously. Claire is taken aback, but believes the awkwardness came from the grogginess of him having just woken up from a nap.
    
    “Not that long ago, I wanted to surprise you by giving you the privilege of seeing me twice today! Did you want to go grab some food?” Claire asks excitedly and hurriedly. She notices something feels off. Flepperblip hasn’t even attempted to touch her. Not her hand, not her face, not her waist. Claire’s stomach grumbles and she smiles again. Flepperblip simply nods and makes a move to the side, so as to stand up. Still without touching Claire. Once he turns away, she slightly raises her shoulder, sniffing in her scent to check for BO, but she smells as usual.
    
    His every move seems to be a struggle, almost stiff to say. Flepperblip’s eyes dart quickly to the computer screen, which she catches as she looks up and notices the brown blog has popped up again. This time with even more things written, and she notices something quite peculiar. Why is it that every time I think of Flepperblip,  Flepperblip seems to pop up on the screen? It just did it again. “Felix I wasn’t going to ask, but what the hell is that on the screen, and who is Flepperblip?” asks Claire hurriedly, disgusted almost, at the infringement on her personal thoughts. Flepperblip turns around, adjusting his gaze unnaturally. Then he smiles again.
    
    “Where is the teddy bear I gave you? Narratron must be feeling lonely.”
    
    ”His name is Narratron?” Claire says, baffled. ”Actually that’s not even the issue right now. What the fuck is this program?” Flepperblip’s smile slowly fades yet again, and he takes a deep sigh. He looks down at his hands, opening and closing them slowly as if doing it for the first time in his life. ”I need to tell you something and I don’t think you’re gonna like it very much.”
    
    ”Well, let’s hear it.” 
    
    “About five years ago there was a coding competition that me and a couple of highschool friends decided to join. It was worth a lot of money. I mean life changing money. And we ended up developing an AI model that, unfortunately, didn’t get selected by the company throwing the event. But instead, they referred us to this other company–”
    
    “Just get to the point Felix.”
    
    “Okay. ” his face half dark from the lack of light on the right side of the room. “Sorry.” the temperature still too cold, Claire’s hands were now tucked into the pockets of her sweatshirt. Yet Flepperblip seemed to pay it no mind. “This company conducted classified top of the market research, so to have the opportunity to work with them as a highschooler was like a dream. But all of my friends dropped out of the project after hearing the proposition.”
    
    “Which was?” Claire leaned forward a little bit, resting her elbows on her knees, hands cupping her face, staring intensely at him from the gaming chair on which she was now seated. Flepperblip stood leaning on the computer table, back standing straighter than usual.
    
    “Confidential. There were some ethical concerns. But it was a lot of money.” he says with some semblance of a thought in between. 
    
    “Do you even know the full extent of what you are doing?”
    
    “No.”
    
    “Does the teddy bear you gave me,” she pauses mid sentence. Breathing a long puff out. “Have something to do with it?” Claire asks, leaning back on the chair. “Is that why I wouldn’t like hearing about this?” Claire follows in a tired tone, as if she had expected him to pull something on her since long ago.
    
    Yet Flepperblip heeds her no answer. He simply leans forward, stealing her lips in a captivating movement. Claire finds herself giving in quickly, not wanting to think about how the one gift she thought was nice, might as well have been a ploy.

    Clazzmozzle stands up from the bed and walks to the bathroom in a room now completely dark, not even knowing what time of the day it is, only that it is no longer their anniversary. When did he turn off the computer? I didn’t feel him stand up during the night. Clazzmozzle notices she actually remembered nothing from her sleep. Which was unusual, given she always had vivid dreams.
    
    Upon reaching for the light switch inside the restroom and flicking it, her eyes have no trouble catching the foreign vibrant red mark by her waist line. Outlining the cutest little teddy bear. Laying upon her right side, on such light and perfect skin. Her hands caressed it for a little. 
    
    Although she had no memory of it, nothing really hurt. She tried to reach back in her thoughts, maybe the drunken night prior? I lost it when he pulled out the “alcohol for special times” basket.. But her head zings, almost like an electrical shock, prompting her to proceed with what she came to the restroom to do. It does look quite cute anyways, now I can have Narratron on me at all times.

    Clazzmozzle had just gotten to school, as she was heading straight to her class, on track to get there in time, her phone rings with a call from a strange number. Her eyes look down to read “Potential Spam”, but before she can register what is happening, she feels a thud on her shoulder.
    
    “Ouch, watch where you’re going!” a blonde girl exclaims as Clazzmozzle now looks at her face, rubbing her own shoulder. Clazzmozzle only smiles, nodding her head in one quick and polite, enough, bow. 
    
    “I hope you have some clarity of mind today, so it helps you understand who is at fault for this bump.” Clazzmozzle says and turns to leave.

    After a day of avoiding everyone on campus, and taking a nap at the hiddenmost corner of the library to avoid being seen open-mouthed while sleeping, Alicentize heads home at the late hour of 4pm. 
    
    Not without stopping by the library front desk to touch the 18 year old newly hired librarian’s hand and hit on him, almost a ritual by now.

    Andrew finishes shaking his newly made business partner’s hand. I wish I could eat ramen tonight. Proud of himself, he walks straight from the office to the subway.

    Andrew waits behind the yellow line and hops into his unusually empty subway car, but pays it no mind. His phone rings and he picks it up promptly. It is his neighbor, kindly calling to tell him she left some ramen packages that her daughter left behind after moving out for college today. And he thought the day couldn’t get any better.

    Andriskels opens his eyes inside the subway, already seated in a proper seat. Not a preferential seat this time at least. He feels slightly dizzy. Almost stiff. A teenage boy bumps into his knee, phone in hands, head in headphones, eyes on the screen.

    “Sorry man.” Blake says with his head now turned towards the man sitting, but his eyes, mind, and heart had yet to leave the screen. No way I got it! Blake finally looks at Andriskels.
    
    “Hey do you know Narratron?” Blake asks him as the subway starts moving, his hands reaching up to grab the bar above his head and stabilize himself.
    
    “Sorry, do I know what?” the man answers, the corner of his lip coming up in annoyance.
    
    “Nevermind. Did you just finish sealing a business deal this afternoon?” he switches tracks, attempting to take information out of the man in a different way. Andriskels’ eyes light up, he finally looks happy again.
    
    “I did! How did you know? Actually, don’t tell me. I will tell myself it was my business aura.”
    
    Chuckling, Blake turns away and walks, sitting two cars down, at the first available spot. He picks his phone back up from his pocket, opening the brown blog and reading the chapter’s name: “Blake Fizer.” He smiles even wider. 
    
    Okay now that I can put stuff down here, I need to share with everyone what I have discovered about Narratron, are you ready? He says, watching the words fill out the page as he voiced them in his head. Half way freaked out, but also feeling accomplished he finally had a turn. 
    
    His time had at last come to become famous on the internet. On his favorite blog no less. 
    
    I was looking at the earliest logs of Narratron and something seems really off. The chapters are never the same length, sticking with some people for days, while for others, only a few minutes or hours. There has to be a larger goal involved in this blog’s existence. So here goes my guess! Cloning! They are– The subway suddenly stops moving and his thoughts are cut off abruptly. The lights go out immediately, as if they had hit something on the tracks. 
    “They are scanning our brains and trying to keep it a secret!” he exclaims in realization, as he notices the silencing is happening to him, as he had seen in other chapter entries on the blog. There is no way this is a natural occurrence!

    Blake stands up, attempting to run to the first car to escape the subway’s closed doors. But he doesn’t make it past Andriskels before he feels a thud on his neck.

    Blarvax had arrived at the restaurant downtown. Sitting, as he waited for the waiter to come take his order. Man, I really wish I could meet Flepperblip. To know just how he developed such an astounding model as a college student. Blarvax looks across the room and almost not believing it himself, recognizes Flepperblip sitting at a table with a girl on the other side of their two seater. 
    
    Blarvax stands up and hurries to his table, taking Flepperblip’s hand unceremoniously. Shaking it furiously, eyes glossed in admiration.

    Flepperblip freezes in place. Not metaphorically. His body is unable to move. Not responding to his wishes.
    
     Clazzmozzle, sitting in front of him for their date night dinner, stands up and removes the other man’s hand from her husband’s. She does so quite harshly, causing his shirt to fly up just enough from her hand sweep that they could see the telltale teddy bear mark turning black. Blarvax looked hurt, and defeatedly dragged his feet across the restaurant back to his seat, mumbling some sort of apology. Flepperblip came back to reality. Clutching his right side of the belly in, where his teddy bear tattoo once again glistened in red. He shoots Clazzmozzle a look, and she promptly understands and picks up her phone. She exhales slowly, as if mourning. She flips the screen towards Flepperblip, and he joins in her vigil upon seeing the brown blog record “Felix Quentin.” For a second time. No one gets a second time.
    
    “The bastard must have wished for it..” Flepperblip says dimly, still clutching his painful side. Neither of them knew what would happen once the company checked the logs to see their system had faulted. A hole he hadn’t thought of while coding, mostly because Narratron had not been made to become what he was now.

    In his last moments before hitting the ground, Flepperblip regretted not having put time into understanding Clazzmozzle himself, instead of relying on his stupid breakthrough research. But now, it was too late.
    
    As the speakers fell down, unsurprisingly, one hit Clazzmozzle right on the top of her head. Knocking her out before her arms could reach a falling Flepperblip. Who had hit the ground so hard, nothing left of him could classify as human anymore. Yet no blood was seen, only some things resembling metal and some kind of  black sludge.

    Felix’s eyes opened, looking around him at the dim area, which seemed to stretch farther than human eyes could reach. His body feeling weak and sore, as if he hadn’t used it for a long time. His mind finally gaining some clarity and autonomy of his own thoughts. 
    
    An IV line dug deep into his hand, and it hurt too much to move it. Felix looked to his left side, eyes now adapting to the darkness and saw thousands of beds just like the one he laid upon. Each populated by a suspended body just like his had a minute ago.
    
    But he felt a warm hand on his free arm, along with his shoulder being soaked in an enveloping wet warmth accompanied by low whimpers. He didn’t even have to look to know who it was. He could finally touch his real Claire again. He felt apologetic for involving so many people. But above all else Felix regretted involving Claire in this. In a mess he hadn’t even known the first layer of. But he sensed she already knew how he felt, and just gave in. Holding her in a one arm embrace as strong as any hugs can be. 
    
    His true Claire, touched with his true hands.
    <button class="popup-button" onclick="openModal('Although this isn’t the longest piece I have written, it is the short story that has undergone the most changes. There were so many ideas surrounding this world and the company’s plan, as well as Felix’s own crazy goals, that conveying it all, while still not quite saying it straight out, was challenging. I considered excluding other big elements like Narratron’s wishing mechanism, but the story felt empty without it. So instead I opted for more instances where it happens, and clear mentions back to moments when the wishes were made. Which will hopefully click in the reader’s mind and reward them for paying attention. Dialogue in this piece was my proudest achievement, as I spoke everything out loud so many times I almost have their talks memorized. I attempted to relay the characters’ personalities along with their mood in each line spoken, as well as the thoughts. What I found hard was to choose which thoughts should be presented and which ones shouldn’t, since Narratron is technically the one picking, and he is censoring things in his blog left and right.One of the main things added were the “scan completed” and code numbers for each time Narratron deletes content, and this seems to clear up quite a bit of confusion. Overall, the action narration had to be a lot clearer, since my literal narrator writes in such a complicated voice, almost with his own personality, yet needs to deliver present tense activities without over-explaining the world.The main characters in the story all have complicated personalities and relationships, making decisions many of us wouldn’t have, but that is what makes them so interesting to follow. Cloning is indeed an overused trope, but this piece attempts to bring a new way/perspective of this idea. Where not only is the company behind Narratron hoping to replace everyone with clones they can control, but still keep their support by providing entertainment through the blog posts, making humans more susceptible for the transfer of consciousness.Narratron definitely needs even more edits to truly hold itself as a “perfect” story, but I enjoy it the way it is right now, and I hope you do too!')">
