        <p><b>I’ll take the corn </b> <br> <br> <br> 

          the buttery, glistening smell, you claim to hate <br> <br>
          
          poured from a slender fountain, against all health codes <br> <br>
          
          I chose you to share this moment with, but the tickets are expensive<br> <br>
          
          that first heavenly crunch, you complain hurts your teeth<br> <br>
          
          mouth coated in warmth, you choose to let out in disdain<br> <br>
          
          fingers covered in grease to be sucked on, you brought napkins for <br> <br>
          
          the room at the perfect lighting, we could have done this at home<br> <br>
          
          eyes anywhere but the big screen, we’ve seen this before<br> <br>
          
          the movie I mean<br> <br>
          
          an excuse<br> <br>
          
          to eat the miraculous<br> <br>
          
          irresistible<br> <br>
          
          addictive<br> <br>
          
          heaven sent<br> <br>
          
          piping hot<br> <br>
          
          popped corn.<br> <br>
          
          Have you really ever loved anything like I love popcorn?<br> <br>
          
          Popcorn doesn’t complain, it mingles in my mouth quietly<br> <br>
          
          until I take action upon it<br> <br>
          
          popcorn is always there for me<br> <br>
          <pre>
          I will trade anything for popcorn<br> <br>

          </p>
          <button class="popup-button" onclick="openModal('Who would have thought “Corn” had so much content in it that it could be made into so many versions! The idea of an unrequited love didn’t exactly click with me, but the trading someone for popcorn due to their treatment of the speaker did. “I’ll take the corn” explores conflicting feelings, as you love someone and attempt to share other things you love with them, just to get brought down and told what you like is stupid or unhealthy. The structure becomes quite chaotic as the narrator is going through these decisions inside their mind of whether this is even with trying anymore, or if sticking to popcorn is the better option. IT incorporates speech into the phrases without any warning, so this was a new challenge for me to accomplish, but I think it comes across pretty clearly. The endings of the lines are dragged out for longer than you’d want in a poem, because the narrator also doesn’t want to hear that. It is annoyingly tagged and present in most lines, until she can focus solely on the popcorn, and realizes, maybe she really likes popcorn more than anything, and should prioritize her own happiness.Notice the ending line between the two corn children is a little different. When feeling nostalgic you wish to go back, but at the same time you know you wouldn’t want to go through everything again. Whereas in the middle of a drawn out argument with a partner, you feel as if you can take any action. Though you may regret it later.')">

I would argue decisions aren’t just a part of life, instead
			the culmination of all your choices       is
	           life.                                                                       

So whether you let me    into your story, as I made you         be          mine, is 
			           your choice,     
                      not mine…

Although I am       <i>or at least was</i>
            just an empty sheet of paper 
                      who chose to let you        <i>and your “love”</i>
scribble all over    
me.			 Pay close attention, please!  <i>Just this once, if never again</i>

So why didn’t you?                              Did you just decide you couldn’t, 
       With this attitude,                                  or are you really unable to?
I just know you won’t even try.                             Maybe you just lack the         vision….

Let’s calm down together, shall we?
  Inhale through your noseee   .      .      .      .       .    .       .         .     .      .

	It burns your nose a little huh? For a split SECOND.
		But it doesn’t hurt, it’s easy…

							  Put me down in front of you,
                                                                   jump twice in place,

 				  and clap your hands twice! As hard as you can!

Pick me back up please. Now,                                                                   

			         were you counting how long it took you to do all of that?

                      Yes!                                                            No…

      Huh? I never asked you to do all that!                           Too bad! The world
      Don’t just assume things…                                            requires you to

         I even asked you to concentrate..                           what they need,
                                  				                  -1 point,

Try touching the tip of your nose,
                                         it doesn’t feel warm 
			          does it?

	But you just recently used it so hard          <i>some would even call it abuse</i>
			and yet this little piece of 
						YOUR
  							prized collection     of body parts
					refuses to be grateful for all your hard work!

Give it a little flick then,           
 			 maybe next time it will behave   Like you expect it to

		Though I must apologize, it seems most                         
		    of you reading me were looking                         
		          positive points to add to your nonexistent point count
			    in the nonexistent points system, but       
  			           nothing you ever did was positively awarded
										by someone else

									    Yet the 
										     DECISION
								     to follow any of this was all yours,
							just like I couldn’t force you to love anyone,
						especially not 
yourself.
					Because you get to choose the type of love you give,
                            						thought it may not be 
 								 		            LOVE
								per everyone else’s standards

That’s assuming you did what I asked you to.                             
Perhaps you chose to read me still,                                
	from the comfort of your couch.  I already expected that              
Yet your conscience                                 
		         DOESN’T weigh you down after                          
       a complete disregard for my wishes,                       
	  even though you knew it would make me happy and             
		none of it would                
  HURT you in any way                
 
		Yet perhaps, I am the stupid one
			sitting around waiting for the day
						WHEN someone,
	<i>maybe anyone other than you</i>                                        will
  					pick me up and show me that, loving me
		                                       is not an effort to be made,							nor something I should be eternally grateful for
						or need to argue for,
					          or all my wants, 
  ignore.
    But that it is simply a thoughtless motion,                                                  

    as I fall                                                                         
			    RIGHT                                                                     
					   into                                                               
 							their

          <button class="popup-button" onclick="openModal('This piece is one of my most experimental designs. I got inspired by those awful commercials of games where you make your choices and the story “changes” based on them. The plots always seem so futile that I can only imagine the person behind them is laughing in sarcasm whilst writing it. This piece is written from the viewpoint of the paper (or tablet) itself, as it knows the “plot” it asks you to follow is dumb, yet you feel like you should do it anyway… or not. Revising this was a pain–not just because I needed to re-format for every font size, font style and double spacing, but–because the paper has its own voice, and it is hard to lay it out, since the speaker does not want her full wishes known. As stated, you should be able to guess. Yet, it should still be clear enough.It attempts to show that just because you see something from one perspective, it doesn’t mean it is the right one. Or even if there is a right side. Our paper is clearly not mentally stable or suited for being so demanding in a relationship. What she wants, shouldn’t be something you ask of someone else. But the person she speaks of is also not quite in the right. The piece attempts to show how unhealthy all sides in a relationship can be when your expectations aren’t or cannot be met. All delivered in a slightly humorous tone, until she switches to instability, something commonly seen in people with mental constraints. This poem is almost not a poem for how prose-y it is, but it still has a poem taste to it. It started as just choices with consequences on a ripped piece of paper, where at the end, the player dies. Clearly, that didn’t translate its meaning well outside of my brain, so I went with the paper itself demonstrating just how tiring the process of gifting yourself to someone, while not receiving anything back is. Even if she may be wrong. This piece has seen many formats, but playing with the page back and forth seems to be the right answer. Just like the person she speaks of played with her feelings, just to eventually discard her. She is a piece of paper after all.')">

      <strong>My dream</strong> <br> <br>
  
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You said <br> <br>
Chasing dreams,  <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterthoughts, <br><br>
forgotten in the morning <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembered when needed most <br><br>
no matter how hard you poke,<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will only come back if,<br> <br>
you forget it completely.<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You love them,<br> <br>
so let them go.<br> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After collecting so many dreams,<br> <br>
putting all the shiny little pieces behind me<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on display for anyone with eyes<br> <br>
anyone that looks like my dreams<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone that cares for it<br> <br>
anyone that talks like you<br> <br>
and looks like you <br> <br>
and smells like you<br> <br>
and I-<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chased    –all–   of my dreams<br> <br>
to look behind me <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and find <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing<br> <br>
      <br> <br>
If I needed to step on my own<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beautiful things<br> <br>
to get here,<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a place without you,<br> <br>
why couldn't anyone have told me<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it hurts more than <br> <br>
it comforts my heart,<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to have the knowledge <br> <br>
the freedom,<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to destroy everything I loved for   –one–    dream<br> <br>
  <br> <br>
I close my eyes at night<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barely containing my excitement.<br> <br>
I close my eyes because that is the only way<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see you,<br> <br>
that I can almost remember how you said my name.<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dream.<br> <br>
<button class="popup-button" onclick="openModal('For this piece I wanted to play around with how it feels to be inside a dream, even though you know it is not reality, yet you choose to believe it is true. The poem has two clear indentations, and both read separately, conveying different feelings, almost like the little angel and little demon on your shoulder, as you make the decision to throw yourself further into a feeling you know is no longer real. But it also reads together as almost a cry for help, the narrator is stuck in the need for this dream, living in the past. This piece needed the least revision because it took the longest to write, since matching up grammar to work in both indentations separately, and as one thing, was complicated in and of itself, but I wanted a challenge.  Revising involved grounding the piece a little more by giving some context, but I can’t add more tactile feeling without taking away the “if you blow once, it might just fall apart” dreamlike aura of the poem. It leaves you bittersweet, as you know the choice made by the speaker is her own, but it hurts nevertheless.')">

  <strong>Exquisite cake’s corpse</strong>
  <br> <br>
All the strawberries for the cake had gone bad<br> <br>
The birthday is today<br> <br>
But he couldn’t get the fuzzy, white,<br> <br>
crumbly,<br> <br>
Feeling off his fingers<br> <br>
     They couldn’t possibly go in the chiffon now<br> <br>
     <br> <br>
Like washing your hands from stench,<br> <br>
No amount of soap can clean such a trauma<br> <br>
<br> <br>
The cake, 4 hours, counting<br> <br>
The birthday, 30 minutes<br> <br>
So much depends on<br> <br>
Cake<br> <br>
<br> <br>
The apple sauce, all over the floor<br> <br>
Supposed to replace the egg <br> <br>
Now replacing the<br> <br>
Dog piss stain on the floor<br> <br>
<br> <br>
The uncle deserved it<br> <br>
He deserved apple piss sauce<br> <br>
<br> <br>
But maybe the cake,<br> <br>
 wasn’t all that important<br> <br>
The dinosaur egg in the living room, <br> <br>
was<br> <br>
Cared for everyday like a child<br> <br>
Said to be due 2 weeks ago, <br> <br>
Considered using that egg in the cake<br> <br>
Better than apple piss sauce<br> <br>
<br> <br>
Had he considered using the egg…<br> <br>
even before the apple piss <br> <br>
became pissed?<br> <br>
<br> <br>
No one is safe <br> <br>
From the fuzzy<br> <br>
Piss<br> <br>
Cake<br> <br>
<button class="popup-button" onclick="openModal('This was an attempt at the exquisite corpse challenge. I liked just how chaotic it turned out, and so this was the second version, where everything is a little more connected. My take on it was that an almost “refrain” usage, with the idea of the, now disgusting, apple sauce, was a nice way to connect the poor egg in the living room and the cake. But had he, indeed, considered eating the egg even before it was a last resort?')">

      <strong>Reflection Essay</strong>

It’s that time of year again, except this is likely my last as an undergrad, and I can’t decide how I should feel about it. Throughout my time at Mines, I came to understand what true despair means—but definitely not content-wise. Hell, the classes were the easiest part. It was staying alive that truly hurt. Though I don’t think just “hurting” begins to describe it. 

But I am not ungrateful–there were always two lights in my time living here.

One is the walking, breathing and talking inspiration to all my writing, although he will probably never know. It seems everything I write turns into a love story, because all the words I can ever spout, wouldn’t begin to describe what I seem to feel. 

The second light was the given ability to learn how to come as close to describing such a feeling, as words can, allowing me to try, and fail, for the rest of my life.

Creative writing has always been like a tiny stray cat lodged somewhere around my esophagus. I’d sometimes try to cough it out to let it rest elsewhere. Come on, I can’t afford eating AND a cat. 

I have also attempted to fully swallow it, just so it would stop hurting. But the fur and its claws were always against being shoved downwards. 

Your classes have taught me that living with this cat right in the middle, isn’t half bad. Often I feed it new techniques and it grows. Although It may grow to be too big, so I slowly need to open my chest, making more space for the kitty, before I try to pet him again. 

Other times I’d throw it a yarn ball and see how it plays. You never know what it will do with that mouse it found in the corner. He might just kill it. Or adopt it as a new pet. 

I have figured out that the reason I can’t fathom thinking like a writer anymore, is because the kitty already settled into his life here. So he thinks for me. I can no longer read a book without noticing just how many tiny mistakes get through so many editing stages. Or questioning their transition choices. Although me and the kitty can’t help but crave more.

This semester, I have read more than the rest of my whole life combined. And it seems to only be getting worse, as the kitty sees his friends playing with different kinds of toys, and wants to try all of them out. As a proud owner, I couldn't leave it hanging, so I have also written a lot. Although most of it is… subpar. It’s at these revealing moments where I realize the words on the paper shouldn’t have been placed together in that order, that I remember you telling us we need to let ourselves write garbage before anything good comes out. 

But man is it a lot of garbage. 

I have taken to waking up in the middle of my dreams to write down genius ideas (most of which are just… let’s say they were genius to unconscious me!), or taking drives to places I haven’t been to in Colorado, exploring the attractions that no one recommends, to understand how the place feels, and write from their perspectives. 

I don’t know how people feel about this one, but I love sitting in cafes and listing all the traces of the humans around me, hearing some of their conversations and creating scenarios to put them in. How would they respond if this cup of coffee were to suddenly fly across the table? Remember: hypothetical scenarios only! Then I remember Leona Sevick saying her family hates the poems about them, but she writes them anyways. And that makes me comfortable again, after all, it may resemble someone, but it is entirely my perspective of what they are. Poking the little bear on this page won’t hurt the actual one, so it’s okay.

But I think most of all, writing makes me free. I can make my world and drag people into it. 
As fast or as slowly as I wish.
As harshly or softly as your mental bounds will let me.
Keep their minds as close to each Arial letter encoded in binary as I want, or as far as the corner of the bedroom that barely gets any light.

I have known this, and have been slowly working on fixing it, but my greatest downfall is my inability to concatenate. I stick to my own writing biases, which involve extremely short poems paired with extremely long fiction. This may be something I struggle with for the rest of my life, but I have learnt many techniques to at least notice where I can fix it in little steps. 

And for that I can only thank you Seth, for you have pointed out all the potential you can see in my writing, and taught me how to say that something probably needs to be rewritten 15 times before it is barely enjoyable, without hurting anyone’s feelings (this ability has proven useful even in my workplace, more times than I thought I would need to reprimand adults in a lifetime…). But you have also helped me notice when I am down, even if I hadn’t caught on yet. And I recently realized that the more I read and write, the easier it is to read people. So I can only imagine how much you must have read and written over your life to do it so well. Hence, I have been practicing this to translate this deeper understanding of someone into my writing as well.

All this to say, if I ever invent a true hoverboard, you will have one. And if I ever publish any writing, you will be in the acknowledgments, so thank you for making this class, and every other class you teach, the most welcoming environment I could think of in a school full of nerds. I am eternally grateful.
